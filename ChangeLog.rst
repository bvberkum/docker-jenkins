0.0.2
  - Automated 2.0 setup with prepared XML views added, slaves, jobs, and
    triggers from tables, credentials and clouds from JSON.

0.0.3
  - Still testing Jenkins 2.0 (2.7 available).
  - Moved from docker-machine to docker 1.11 in Vagrant vbox.
    1.12 is atm. not compatible with docker-jenkins plugin. [#]_
  - Contains cloud setup with three images. Two pre-build, pre-started slaves,
    one which works. Lots of auxiliary and personal jobs are added and
    triggered. Not all work for now, but Jenkins does.
    See also first edition of setup guide.
